<h1>The Best Movies According To Chisom</h1>
<h2>My Top Seven (7) Movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Lupin</h3>
<p>Lupin is my favorite movie because he exerts less brute force to get things done. Lupin is a smart man who is also a con artist good at using his intelligence, con and guise to steal from the rich and give to the poor. More like a robinhood.</p>

<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
<p>This is the story of a man in his late fourties diagnosed with cancer and told he has a specific period of time to live before the cancer takes him. He then opts to production of hard drugs called methamphetamine. His involvement puts his life and family in danger.</p>

<h3>Blacklist</h3>
<p>A man called Raymond Reddington who is a wanted criminal gives up himself to the FBI as an informant in order to have access to classsified informations and use the FBI to fight other existing threats and also protect his daughter</p>

<h3>Black Pather</h3>
<p>Not to sound racial but we have seen so many super heroes from various continents all over the world but we have not had the chance to see one from Africa. Black Panther was that first African super hero with a unique ability to charge his suit from attack hits</p>

<h3>Hercules</h3>
<p>The story of a demi-god and how he overcame so many other gods with favor from zZeus his father.</p>

<h3>Coach Carter</h3>
<p>A basketball movie that teaches that with the right amount  of hardwork, confidence, discipline and perseverance, you can achieve success.</p>

<h3>The Pope's Exorcist</h3>
<p>Horror, Catholic history, casting out demons in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and by the power of God ALmighty. The plots of the devil and the bargain made by a man of God; a Pope nonetheless, to save the soul of a girl who turned out to be his sin; his daughter.</p>
